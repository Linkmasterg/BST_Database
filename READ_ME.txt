When entering ID #s, do not enter any number outside the integer limit. Please stick to the given boundaries. Most any integers will work, but ones outside the integer storage limit ~ +-2billion will sometimes cause infinite loops.

When [12] is called, the student is left without an advisor. But I am going to implement it so the advisor's successor becomes the student's new advisor (I asked my classmate Murphy about this problem and she said Rene recommended this idea).
If the student's advisor does not have a successor, I set the student's advisor to 0 and print a message to add an advisor. (call 11)
